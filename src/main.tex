    \textbf{Abstract}
\end{center}
Interval algebras were first introduced by Allen to reason about time intervals qualitatively. As
a result they have been mainly of interest in computer science, where their applications and
questions about decidability have been considered. However, so far they have not been studied in a
model theoretic capacity: for example pinning down their axioms and finding their out what
properties their models have.

In this report we provide a first order axiomatisation of Allen's interval algebra and we show
two constructions: the interval construction $\inter$ sending a linear order to the interval algebra
of its non-zero intervals ; and the points $\points$ construction sending an interval algebra to
the linear order of start and end points of its intervals. We show these constructions give rise to
a pair of adjoint functors, and we leverage this to show the Fraïssé limit of the finite interval
algebras is $\inter[\Q]$. From a stability theory perspective, we show that the stable interval
algebras are exactly the finite interval algebras and that for any linear order $L$, $\inter[L]$
has the non-independence property.

    \textbf{Acknowledgements}
\end{center}
No man is an island and this project would not have been possible without the help of many people,
for whom I wish to express my deepest gratitude.

Above all I would like to thank my supervisor Dr. Robert Barham for suggesting this topic and
guiding me through the different areas of model theory covered in this work, giving me the much
needed intuition and historical context to fully appreciate it. It is impossible
to overstate the importance of Robert's support and encouragement, both for this work and other
academic endeavours.

I would also like to thank my second marker Dr. Charlotte Kestner for her feedback on my interim
report, which helped me flesh out the introduction and background sections of this work into their
current version.

Finally I want to thank my personal tutor Prof. Paul Kelly for the very interesting conversations
over the past four years and for hearing me ramble about my project during tutor meetings. I will
also thank my parents and friends for their support throughout the project and for being willing
to act as my rubber duckies whenever I got stuck.

\section{Evaluation}

At the start of this project we had one objective, that is to come up with some axioms for the
theory of interval algebras and study their model theoretic consequences. As such, it is important
to consider the models allowed by our axioms and whether these were too strong or too weak.

Firstly, the given axiomatisation is finite, so reasoning about interval algebras with them is
quite simple since the axioms are all explicitly listed. If we had given the theory of interval
algebras as the full theory of some structure or as the set of all sentences such that some property
holds, then this would have complicated the reasoning a lot, since it would not always be obvious
what sentences are in the theory. On the other hand, despite being finite, there were a lot of
axioms in total, making a lot of proofs quite labourious and mechanical. It is unlikely this could
be changed, due to the nature of interval algebras having 13 very different binary relations, but
it is possible that our work could have benefitted from the use of proof automation in a theorem
prover.

Secondly, we saw that the models of $\taia$ were exactly the substructures of $\inter[L]$ for any
strict linear order $L$. The inference algorithm given by Allen took as inputs networks of
intervals, which contained only the time intervals we were interested. Hence the fact that our
axiomatisation allows for arbitrary substructures of $\inter[L]$ seems to agree with Allen's
idea for interval algebras. However, we did also see that the class of interval algebras of the form
$\inter[L]$ is elementary, axiomatisable by adding the sentence $\allints$ to $\taia$. Hence we
found a reasonable extension of the axioms if one thought them to be too weak.

Finally, we managed to compute the Fraïssé limit of $\finaia$ in quite an elegant manner, by
reducing it to the case of strict linear orders. We also saw that the stable interval algebras
are $\finaia$; that any interval algebra of the form $\inter[L]$ has the NIP and an explicit
example of an interval algebra with the IP. So our axiomatisation allowed for a number of
interesting results.
