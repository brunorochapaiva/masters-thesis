    \textbf{Abstract}
\end{center}
Interval algebras were first introduced by Allen to reason about time intervals qualitatively. As
a result they have been mainly of interest in computer science, where their applications and
questions about decidability have been considered. However, so far they have not been studied in a
model theoretic capacity: for example pinning down their axioms and finding their out what
properties their models have.

In this report we provide a first order axiomatisation of Allen's interval algebra and we show
two constructions: the interval construction $\inter$ sending a linear order to the interval algebra
of its non-zero intervals ; and the points $\points$ construction sending an interval algebra to
the linear order of start and end points of its intervals. We show these constructions give rise to
a pair of adjoint functors, and we leverage this to show the Fraïssé limit of the finite interval
algebras is $\inter[\Q]$. From a stability theory perspective, we show that the stable interval
algebras are exactly the finite interval algebras and that for any linear order $L$, $\inter[L]$
has the non-independence property.

    \textbf{Acknowledgements}
\end{center}
No man is an island and this project would not have been possible without the help of many people,
for whom I wish to express my deepest gratitude.

Above all I would like to thank my supervisor Dr. Robert Barham for suggesting this topic and
giving me the much needed intuition to understand a lot of the quite technical concepts in model
theory, as well as the historical context to fully appreciate its results. I started this project
wanting to learn about model theory and I have finished it loving the subject, all thanks to
Robert's guidance.

I would also like to thank my second marker Dr. Charlotte Kestner whose feedback on my interim
report helped me flesh out the introduction and background sections, turning them into pieces of
writing I am very happy with.

Although he has not had any technical involvement with this project, I want to thank my personal
tutor Prof. Paul Kelly for the very interesting conversations we have had over the last four years,
without which I would have missed out on a lot of interesting areas.

Finally, I want to thank my parents Paulo and Paula Paiva for their endless love and support, and
my friends at Imperial College London, especially Aporva, Ben and Xueyan for acting as my
rubber duckies at multiple points in this project.

\section{Evaluation}

At the start of this project we had one overarching objective, that was to come up with some axioms
for the theory of interval algebras and study their model theoretic consequences.
As such the main topic of concern for our evaluation will be deciding how appropriate our
axiomatisation was.

Firstly, we should consider the models allowed by our axiomatisation. We saw that the models of
$\taia$ coincide with the class of substructures of the interval algebras $\inter[L]$.
These are exactly the type of models that underlie the work in \cite{allen83}, on this front
we should be very happy with our axiomatisation. In addition, we also saw that
$\taia \cup \{\allints\}$ axiomatised the class of models of the form $\inter[L]$, letting us
distinguish an important class of models through a single sentence.

In addition, $\taia$ is also finite, meaning there is very little ambiguity when checking
whether a structure is a model or not. On the other hand, despite being finite, there are quite
a lot of axioms in $\taia$ due to its many relations. This means proving things about
interval algebras can be quite labourious, with a lot of quite distinct cases to check. If we could
find some symmetry in the transitivity relations this would help a lot, but there does not seem
to be anything too tangible to simplify reasoning.

Finally, with our given axioms, we managed to prove all of the results we were originally
interested at the start of this project, so our axiomatisation was definitely something we could
work with.
